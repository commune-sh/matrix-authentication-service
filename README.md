# Matrix Authentication Service

MAS (Matrix Authentication Service) is a user management and authentication service for [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) homeservers, written and maintained by [Element](https://element.io/). You can directly run and manage the source code in this repository, available under an AGPL license (or alternatively under a commercial license from Element). Support is not provided by Element unless you have a subscription.

It has been created to support the migration of Matrix to a next-generation of auth APIs per [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3861).

See the [Documentation](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/index.html) for information on installation and use.
